Follow the steps below for Open Server to work correctly

I couldn't put the file here because Github has 100mb restriction :( 
But you can download it from "https://ospanel.io/download/".

1. Download Open Server from the link I gave.
2. Install the setup.
3. Run Open Server.
4. The flag icon will appear at the bottom right, click the icon.
5. Click on "Settings".
6. Switch to the "Modules" section from the tabs that appear.
7. In the window that opens, select MySQL-5.7-Win10 in the MySQL / MariaDB section.
8. Click the "Save" button and exit.
9. Click the Flag icon again and press the "Run server" button.
