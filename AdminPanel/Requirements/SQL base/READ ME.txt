For the codes to work correctly, you need to add my SQL base to your Open Server.

First of all, you need to activate MySQLi on your Open Server.
To activate, follow the steps shown below:
1. Run Open Server.
2. Click the flag icon.
3. Run "Console" from the "Advanced" section.
4. After the console opens, type "mysql -u root -p" and press enter.
5. You will see a text like "Enter password:". Do not type anything here and press enter again.
6. Close the console.


To add my SQL base, follow the steps shown below:
1. Click the flag icon.
2. Make sure Open Server is still on, if it is off, run it again with the "Run server" button.
3. Then click the "PhpMyAdmin" button from the "Advanced" section.
4. In the Opera tab that opens, type root in the "Username" field and leave the "Password" blank, then press the "Login" button.
5. Press the "New" button in the new tab that opens.
6. Type "uni_base" in the "Database name" field and press the "create" button.
7. Then you will see the database "uni_base" with the given one, click on it.
8. Press the "Import" button in the new tab that opens.
9. Click on "Choose file" in the tab that opens and add the "uni_base.sql" SQL base I gave you there.
10. Press the "Import" button at the bottom.
11. You will see that the koika table has been added to the "uni_base" database.


If you see the "koika" table you did everything right. Otherwise, try reviewing the steps again.
