Hello,

My name is Aykhan.
I wrote "Admin Panel" here. The codes are completely mine and I continue to edit some parts of it.

Requirements for the code to work:
1. OpenServer. (It is in the requirements file.)
2. After downloading Open Server, put the "AdminPanel" file in the shortcut "C:\OSPanel\domains". (Since the database you will use will be on the open server, you need to add the codes to the OpenServerin file.)
3. You need to add the SQL base created by me to your Open Server. (It is in the requirements file.)
4. If you have completed all the steps correctly, you can now run the codes.

NOTE: I write my codes in Notepad++, but you can open it in any program you want, still I recommend Notepad++.
